# JSL03 Project Brief: Console-Based Task Manager

## Description 📜:

This project required us to build upon the previous project, JSL02's coding solution.
Starting with the previous project (JSL02): it involved implementing a JavaScript-based task entry system where users could input two tasks with complete details, ensuring data consistency and validation. The system was intended to guide users through entering valid task titles, descriptions, and statuses, enforcing correct formatting while maintaining code clarity and maintainability.
Both these projects needed to showcase the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript with proper usability and functionality.
This current project (JSL03): challenged us by having three set tasks, in need of three more tasks but **not** on the board.

## Task 🖊️:

We were tasked to successfully input the given coding solution of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, of JSL02, into our current project JSL03 (whether by downloading/ copying, and pasting the files in). Then, we were to proceed by completing the rest of the JavaScript file, for interactivity. Lastly, we needed to add a professional README - with a thorough breakdown of our project requirements and process.

## Techonolgy 💻:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features 🎨:

- Console readability, for the developer.
**For the programmer**, the console will serve as visual aid upon inspection - on the progress of the user.
- Console log case change (from UpperCase to LowerCase).

## Setup ⚙️:

CodeSpace gave us a file, that I cloned and forked from Git. I copied the link into VS Code and linked it into my JSL Projects file.
